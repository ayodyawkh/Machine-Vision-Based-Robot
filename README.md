# Machine Vision Based Robot
This is a project which we did for the Robot Design and Competition Module in semester 3. 
In this task we had to complete several subtasks.

* Line following <br />
    The robot must follow a white line on a black surface. These paths may contain straight lines, curved lines, or dotted line segments. 
* Wall maze following <br />
    After a line following section, the robot will have to navigate through a wall maze section. This maze will not contain any looping paths. (A single possible path from start to end is guaranteed.)
* Mosaic Floor Area <br />
    The robot exiting the wall maze should immediately enter the mosaic floor area and proceed to complete the following subtasks. Inserting the key solids to respective keyholes to close the bridge. Collecting the ball of the color assigned to your team at the start of the competition.
* Bridge  <br />
    The robot should cross the closed bridge and exit the area to a dotted line segment.
* Shooting area <br />
    The robot must choose the correct path at the Y junction area according to the color assigned. While staying in the restricted space, the robot will have to shoot the collected ball through the goal.
